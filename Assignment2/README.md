# Data Wrangling II

## Problem Statement

Create an **academic performance** dataset of students and perform the following operations using Python:

1. Scan all variables for missing values and inconsistencies.  
   If there are missing values and/or inconsistencies, use any suitable techniques to deal with them.

2. Scan all numeric variables for outliers.  
   If there are outliers, use any suitable techniques to deal with them.

3. Apply data transformations on at least one of the variables.  
   The purpose of this transformation should be one of the following:
   - To change the scale for better understanding of the variable  
   - To convert a non-linear relation into a linear one  
   - To decrease the skewness and convert the distribution into a normal distribution
